### GoT API task for Tango Agency

Added offline behaviour as a bonus (disconnect your network to evaluate)

Added redux-saga + redux toolkit. Created custom culture helper based
on hstoric data (successful api calls)

Evaluation criteria
There are certain aspects that will be considered when evaluating your solution:
- code quality +
- implementation according to the specifications +
- expertise in using React +
- expertise in using external dependencies + 
- expertise in working with HTML5 and Web APIs +
- expertise in working with CSS +
- expertise in calling external APIs +


Background

Your task is to implement a simple React app for displaying data from An API of Ice And
Fire. That API uses no authentication and is available over HTTPS. The application would
be deployed using static files hosting.

For simplicity, the application should only display 2 data types: Characters and Houses.
Business requirements

The application, as the entry point, should display the Table of Characters page.

From the Table of Characters link each House displayed to a dedicated page with the House
Details.

From the House Details page it should be possible to go back to the Table of Characters
page..


Table of Characters
Columns
Character
Concatenate character name and aliases fields using comma.
Alive
Based on born and died fields:
- Display "Yes" when Character has not died.
- Display "No, died at X years old" when Character has died, where X is his age in years
at the time of death.
Gender
Display "Unknown" when not available.

Culture
Display "Unknown" when not available.
Allegiances
Display list of House id fields based on what is found in allegiances field.
Link each House displayed to a dedicated page with House details.
\# of Books

Display the count of Books in which the Character appeared.

Filtering
It should be possible to filter the list of Characters returned from API by Gender.
Use select or dropdown with "Male", "Female" and "Unknown" as options.
It should be possible to filter the list of Characters returned from API by Culture.
Use text input.
Pagination
The API returns a single page of 10 results by default. It should be possible to paginate the
results and show at most 25 results per page by default instead.
Application users should also be able to change the number of results per page.
Use select or dropdown with 10, 25 and 50 as options.
Pagination should have the following controls:
- First page
- Previous page
- Next page
- Last page

House Details
The page with the House Details should display the following data:
- Name of the House
- Region
- Coat of Arms
- Words
- Titles
- Seats
- Has died out
- Has overlord
- Number of Cadet Branches

Technical requirements

The solution should be implemented with React using Create React App.
You can use either JavaScript or TypeScript as your technical stack.
You can also use any open source dependencies you want, but be considerate –
dependencies for network requests, routing, timedate manipulations and design systems
should be sufficient.
Create a code repository on Github using Git.
Create a simple static file deployment at your discretion.
Tips

The goal of this task is to provide a discussion context for the subsequent technical interview
and is not meant to be time consuming. Although it is intended for both Junior React
Developers and React Developers, we’re expecting more attention to detail from the latter.
Using solutions recommended by the framework is preferred. You can emphasise on certain
aspects of the task to showcase your skills, either through cleverly using React built in
mechanisms or leaving TODO notes for more advanced solutions that come to your mind.
Do not invest your time into implementing additional business requirements that are not listed
or into creating sophisticated look for the application since there is no design provided. We
would like to see a unit test being showcased, but by any means please do not try ensuring
100% coverage.
